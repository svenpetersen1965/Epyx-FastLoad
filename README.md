# Epyx-FastLoad
A rebuild of the Epyx Fast Load cartridge for the Commodore C64 in the same format like the <a href="https://github.com/bwack/Versa64Cart">Versa64Cart<a>,
The dimensions are the same and the location of the reset switch is the same.

The software and the user manual can be obtained from this website: <a href="https://rr.pokefinder.org/wiki/Epyx_FastLoad">Epyx FastLoad (pokefinder)</a>

There is a version of the Gerber files and the eagle file without a documentation frame, since some PCB manufacturer's websites have a problem with it.
